**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

Designing and programming functions, pair programming, good HCI

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First we read the readme file. After that, we discussed how we wanted to tackle the problem and wrote the algorithm. After that was the testcases and flowchart. Lastly, writing and testing the code.

**What were the Key concepts explored?**

Loops, Defining Functions, Error Checking

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

Yes. The code matches the testcase outcomes.

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. There is built in error checking. 

**What challenges did you encounter?**

We struggled a bit coming up with a way to both keep track of the room number and make the code efficient by using a while loop.

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**

1. Think before Programming: We read the read me file, completed our algorithm, and completed our test cases before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: Our code follows our algorithm
3. Improve through practice: We improved our pair programming / coding skills by completing this lab.


**Did you overcome them, and how?**

Yes. We came up with this line of code.
room_num = f'room {count + 1}' if count < 5 else 'room 5'
This allows us to replace the displayed number to the user, while keeping the variable name the same. This allows us to use a while loop to repeat the action while also keeping the measurements clear to user. 

**Any key takeaways?**

It is very important to plan before you code.

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

Yes I do. I feel a lot better about defining functions

**What was it like working with your partner?**

Good! They're both very nice and easy to work with.
